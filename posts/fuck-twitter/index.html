				<p>I got banned from twitter a few days ago, the day exactly when Elon Musk bought twitter.</p>
<p>Because I was suspened permanently without a prior warning or anything like that, I couldn&rsquo;t find a way to export my data. <strong>I lost all of my data and some connections on it.</strong></p>
<p>99% time I use twitter is about sharing my life, study, etc. I am a kind person, and I do believe I did not violate any rules or post anything that involves hates or anything like that.</p>
<p><strong>There is no sign that indicated which rule that I violated.</strong> The only thing that it said is that &ldquo;After careful review, we determined your account broke the Twitter Rules&rdquo;.</p>
<p>It is ridiculous that the whole &ldquo;suspension process&rdquo; is done by some other guy and there is <strong>no way to guarantee the process is reasonable.</strong></p>
<p>Twitter has been the most widely used social media for chinese-speaking community out side of China and it is a platform where you don&rsquo;t get cencored by the authority. It does help a lot in terms of acquiring news or discussing with other people especially when you live in a place that is full of cencorships.</p>
<p>But twitter is owned by a commercial company, and it <strong>does not guarantee</strong> that something happened to me won&rsquo;t happen again.</p>
<p>After this, it reminds me of how important a real free(free as in freedom) platform is.</p>
